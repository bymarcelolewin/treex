# v0.0.4 - Enhanced Linux Support Summary

## Issue Discovered
During testing on Ubuntu 24.04, TreeX failed to export PNG and WebP formats with cryptic Puppeteer errors:
```
‚ùå Failed:
  - test.png: Could not find Chrome (ver. 138.0.7204.157). This can occur if either
   1. you did not perform an installation before running the script...
```

## Root Cause
- Puppeteer doesn't automatically download Chromium on some Linux distributions (Ubuntu 24.04+)
- Users received confusing technical error messages
- No guidance provided for resolution

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Error Handling (`commands/puppeteer-helper.js`)
**Before:**
- Cryptic Puppeteer error messages
- No user guidance
- Unclear what formats were affected

**After:**
- Friendly, informative error message explaining:
  - Which formats need Chromium (PNG, WebP)
  - Exact command to install Chromium
  - Linux-specific sudo option
  - What formats still work (SVG, Markdown)

```javascript
throw new Error(`
üîß Chromium is required for exporting to PNG and WebP formats, but your system doesn't have it installed.

To install Chromium, please run:
  npx puppeteer browsers install chrome

On some Linux systems, you may need to use sudo:
  sudo npx puppeteer browsers install chrome

Note: SVG and Markdown exports will work without Chromium.`);
```

### 2. Updated Installation Documentation (`README.md`)
**Added Linux-specific guidance:**
```bash
npm install -g @icodewith-ai/treex
```

**Note for Linux users:** You may need to use `sudo`:
```bash
sudo npm install -g @icodewith-ai/treex
```

## Benefits of Changes

### User Experience
- **Clear error messages** instead of technical jargon
- **Actionable solutions** with exact commands to run
- **Platform-specific guidance** for Linux users
- **Graceful degradation** - other formats still work

### Technical
- **Improved error handling** in Puppeteer integration
- **Better cross-platform documentation**
- **Non-breaking changes** - existing functionality unchanged

## Testing
- ‚úÖ Verified error message displays correctly on Linux
- ‚úÖ Confirmed SVG and Markdown exports still work without Chromium
- ‚úÖ Tested that PNG/WebP work after Chromium installation
- ‚úÖ Validated sudo npm installation on Linux

## Impact
- **Reduced support burden** - users can self-resolve Chromium issues
- **Better Linux compatibility** with clear setup instructions
- **Improved user confidence** through transparent error messaging
- **Professional user experience** matching enterprise CLI tools

## Files Modified
1. `commands/puppeteer-helper.js` - Enhanced error handling with user-friendly messages
2. `README.md` - Added Linux installation notes

## Ready for Release
This enhancement is ready for v0.0.4 release:
- Non-breaking changes
- Improved user experience
- Better cross-platform support
- Clear documentation updates

## Future Considerations
- Consider auto-detecting missing Chromium and offering to install
- Add troubleshooting section to README for common Linux issues
- Monitor for similar issues on other Linux distributions
